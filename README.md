# Portfolio

## Description
This website is the landing page of my web developer Portfolio. A showcase of all my projects in order to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp course. Creating this portfolio allows me to demonstrate my ability to use HTML and CSS, generating a visually satisfying and effective functional website. This site will achieve the goal to reach new potential employers as well as other like-minded developers. Constructing this portfolio taught me the functionalites of CSS and the correlation with HTML, these are the highlited profeciones during development process:

* Media queries and responsive designs
* Flexbox
* Semantic HTML
* CSS selectors and variables


## User Story

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
